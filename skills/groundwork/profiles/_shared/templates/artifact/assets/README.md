# `artifact/assets/`

Non-code artifacts the living spec or the tracking board embeds: logos, screenshots, brand marks, exported diagrams, icon SVGs.

`general` profile plans (campaigns, org changes, stakeholder maps) tend to fill this; `software` profile plans often leave it empty.

Anything here is referenced from `artifact/index.html` (living spec) or `artifact/board.html` (tracking board) by relative path (e.g. `<img src="./assets/hero.png">`). Files under `assets/` are not parsed by groundwork actions — they're hand-curated.
