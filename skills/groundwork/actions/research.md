# action: `research` — external + internal research passes

**Loaded when**: the user wants to fill `02-research-external.md` and/or `03-research-internal.md`, or refresh stale research.

**Reads first**: `../lib/state.md`, `../agents/researcher.md`, the plan's current `01-plan.md` (so the agent knows what to research).

**Spine-version**: `expected = "1"`. Runs [`../lib/state.md` §"Spine-version preamble gate"](../lib/state.md#spine-version-preamble-gate) as the first step after loading `.groundwork.json` — writing action, so refuses on either direction of mismatch. No-op at v1=current.

**Spawns**: one researcher agent (via the `Agent` tool, `general-purpose` subagent by default) — or, with `--sweep`, a fan-out of finders via a Workflow (see §"Multi-modal sweep").

---

## What it does

1. **Verify**: `.groundwork.json` exists. If not, refuse and tell the user to run `init`.
2. **Read state**: load `.groundwork.json`. Pull goal + profile + current ids.
3. **Scope the pass**: ask the user (`AskUserQuestion`) whether to run external-only, internal-only, or both. Default: both, if both files exist and have empty findings; otherwise whichever is empty/stale.
3b. **Check for a stranded journal** — see §"Crash durability" below. If `.research-journal-<scope>.md` exists in the plan folder, a previous pass died before folding. Show the user what it holds and ask whether to fold it as-is, resume from it, or discard and start clean. Do not silently overwrite it.
4. **Spawn the researcher** — use `Agent` with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` (or `Explore` if read-only). Pass the brief in `agents/researcher.md` populated with `{goal, profile, scope, target_file, journal_path, stamp}`. Substitute `{stamp}` with today's date yourself — the agent can't read the clock.
5. **Fold the result via the script** — the agent returns structured findings + sources. Write each into its fence with `write-region` (one call per region); the script hash-diffs and reports `WRITTEN` / `UNCHANGED` / `SKIPPED_DIRTY` — never hand-edit the file or its hashes:

   ```bash
   python3 <skill>/scripts/groundwork_state.py write-region \
     --plan <plan> --file 02-research-external.md --id findings \
     --action research --content-file <agent-findings.md>
   # repeat for --id sources, and 03-research-internal.md --id findings
   ```

   On `SKIPPED_DIRTY`, surface the hint to the user (they hand-edited inside the fence) and pass `--force` only with their say-so.
6. **Stamp** via the script (don't hand-edit the anchor): `python3 <skill>/scripts/groundwork_state.py stamp-research --plan <plan> --file 02-research-external.md` (and `03-…` if internal ran).
7. **Report**: print each fence's `write-region` result (which were `WRITTEN` vs `UNCHANGED`).
8. **Clear the journal** — only after step 6 stamps successfully, delete `.research-journal-<scope>.md`. While it exists, it means "a pass ran and was never folded."

---

## Crash durability

The fold in step 5 happens **once, at the end**. That is correct for the fence
hash contract — but on its own it means a session truncated mid-pass loses every
search the agent already did, and the next run starts from nothing. Web research
is the most expensive thing groundwork does and the easiest to lose.

So the researcher keeps a **journal** and writes to it as it goes:

- **Path**: `<plan_folder>/.research-journal-<scope>.md` (dotfile, plan-local).
  Under `--sweep`, one per angle: `.research-journal-<angle>.md`, so concurrent
  finders never clobber each other.
- **Written before the first search**, appended after *every* search, with a
  checkpoint summary every third. Not batched at the end — batching it defeats
  the entire point.
- **Outside every `groundwork:auto` fence.** It is scratch, never hashed, never
  stamped, and doesn't touch the "the agent never edits plan docs" rule, which
  is about the fenced spine files.
- **Existence is the signal.** A journal present at action start (step 3b) means
  the last pass died before folding. Offer to fold it as-is, resume from it, or
  discard. Deleted in step 8 once the fold has stamped.

Add `.research-journal-*.md` to the workspace ignore rules if plan folders are
tracked — the journal is transient by design and shouldn't land in a commit.

## Internal vs external

- **External (`02-research-external.md`)** — researcher uses `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`. Cites every claim with a URL. Findings come back as `## <topic>` sub-sections; sources collected into a unified list at the bottom.
- **Internal (`03-research-internal.md`)** — researcher uses `Grep`, `Glob`, `Read` against the project tree (workspace root or whatever the user is in). Cites with `file_path:line_number`. Finds prior work, existing assets, code that would be touched, constraints.

The agent **never** edits the plan docs directly — it returns content; the action writes it.

---

## Fence layout

`02-research-external.md`:

```markdown
# 02 — External research

Outside research backing the plan. Cite every claim.

<!-- groundwork:auto:start findings -->
<!-- last_action: research · <ISO> -->
…findings, one ## section per topic…
<!-- groundwork:auto:end findings -->

## How to use this file

(hand-authored tips, optional)

<!-- groundwork:auto:start sources -->
<!-- last_action: research · <ISO> -->
1. <Title> — <URL> (accessed <date>)
…
<!-- groundwork:auto:end sources -->
```

`03-research-internal.md` has the same `findings` fence; no `sources` fence (citations live inline as `path:line`).

---

## Profile vocabulary

The brief substitutes:

- `software` profile: "the codebase," "existing code," "prior PRs."
- `general` profile: "existing assets, prior work, current constraints" — no code vocabulary.
- `content` profile: "prior pieces, existing brand assets, the editorial standards, channel performance" — no software vocabulary; research the audience, the competitive content landscape, and precedent pieces.

---

## Re-run semantics

Per `lib/state.md`:

- Identical findings → no write, no `updated` bump.
- New findings → write inside the fence; hand-written prose between fences is byte-identical.
- Researcher returned nothing new → `stamped` updates but the fence content does not (so a "refresh" doesn't churn the file).

If the user has hand-edited inside a fence, the action warns and skips the region unless `--force-rewrite <file>#<region>` is passed.

---

## Multi-modal sweep (`--sweep`)

**Opt-in.** Default is the single general-purpose agent above. With `--sweep`, run a Workflow that fans out **finders by angle** — each blind to the others, so coverage comes from diversity of search lane rather than one agent trying every angle:

| Angle | Scope | Tools | Tier |
|---|---|---|---|
| `external-precedent` | external | WebSearch / WebFetch — prior art, precedents, related research | `sonnet` |
| `external-library-docs` | external | WebSearch / WebFetch — library/API/RFC docs (`software` only) | `sonnet` |
| `internal-codebase` | internal | Grep / Glob / Read — prior work, code that'd be touched | `sonnet` |
| `internal-constraints` | internal | Grep / Glob / Read — constraints already encoded, conventions | `sonnet` |

Only the angles matching the chosen scope run (external-only → first two; internal-only → last two; both → all). Sketch:

```js
const found = (await parallel(ANGLES.map(a => () =>
  agent(researcherBrief(a), { label: a.key, schema: RESEARCHER_SCHEMA, model: 'sonnet' })
))).filter(Boolean)
// synthesis: dedup + merge into the two fence payloads (one agent, sees all finders)
const merged = await agent(synthesisBrief(found), { schema: RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS_SCHEMA, model: 'sonnet' })
return merged
```

`RESEARCHER_SCHEMA` / `RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS_SCHEMA` are in [`../lib/schemas.md`](../lib/schemas.md). Optionally **budget-scale** the finder count: `const N = budget.total ? Math.min(ANGLES.length, Math.floor(budget.total/120_000)) : ANGLES.length`.

**The Workflow returns `merged`; it does not write files** (no filesystem in scripts). The action then writes `merged.external_findings` / `merged.external_sources` / `merged.internal_findings` into their fences via the **same `write-region` path** as the single-agent case (step 5 above), stamps via the script, and reports `WRITTEN`/`UNCHANGED`/`SKIPPED_DIRTY` identically. Pass today's date into the synthesis prompt (scripts can't read the clock). If Workflow isn't available, `--sweep` falls back to the single-agent path with a one-line note.

---

## Composition

groundwork doesn't reimplement web search — it spawns a general-purpose agent (or, under `--sweep`, a fan-out of them) that uses the standard Claude Code research tools. For workspaces with project-specific MCP search (e.g. PostHog, Royalti CMS), the agent's brief notes "use any MCP tools available for project-scoped search" without naming them — the agent reads the tool list at spawn time. Under `--sweep`, Workflow agents reach the same session-connected MCP tools via on-demand schema loading.

---

## Edge cases

- **Empty plan (no `01-plan.md` content beyond placeholders)** — the agent has nothing to search around. Warn the user and suggest writing the plan goal + a few bullets in `01-plan.md` first.
- **No `02`/`03` file present** — `init` always creates them, so this means the user deleted them. Refuse and tell them to run `groundwork init --force` to restore.
- **Stale research (older than 30 days)** — `status` flags it; users can re-run `research` to refresh. The `stamped` date drives this.

## Click-to-fire prompt

The canonical strings the FE emits (palette / WP-card per WP-21). Substitution variables: `{plan_folder}`, `{plan_title}`.

**Standalone slash form**:

```
/groundwork research
```

(invoked from inside `{plan_folder}` — the action reads `.groundwork.json` from cwd. If the user is elsewhere, prefix `cd {plan_folder} && `.)

**Seeded-session form**:

```
Run a groundwork research pass on `{plan_folder}` (plan title: {plan_title}).

If the groundwork skill is loaded in this session, follow its `research` action verbatim — read `.claude/skills/groundwork/actions/research.md` and `.claude/skills/groundwork/agents/researcher.md`, then spawn a researcher agent to fill `02-research-external.md` and `03-research-internal.md` inside their generated-region fences. If the skill is not loaded, read `{plan_folder}/01-plan.md` for context and produce findings + sources by hand, writing inside the existing `<!-- groundwork:auto:start findings -->` fences in the 02 / 03 files.

Cite every external claim with a URL; cite every internal claim with `path:line`. Stamp the run in `.groundwork.json.research.<file>.stamped` to today's date.
```
